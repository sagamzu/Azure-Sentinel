Web Shells are malicious scripts that attackers use to compromise internet facing servers. These are commonly used as a backdoor into the targeted web applications and servers. Microsoft Security Research has highlighted the threat, usage and detection of Web Shells in an enterprise environment in the following blogs: \n\n - [Web shell attacks continue to rise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/02/11/web-shell-attacks-continue-to-rise/) \n\n - [Analyzing attacks taking advantage of the Exchange Server vulnerabilities](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/03/25/analyzing-attacks-taking-advantage-of-the-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/)\n\n**Pre-requisites:**\n\n This is a [domain solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/sentinel-solutions-catalog#domain-solutions) and does not include any data connectors.
